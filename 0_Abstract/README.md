# ABSTRACT
Driving securely requires high level of visibility. A windshield wiper, also known as a wiper blade, is a device that cleans the front window of a car from snow, ice, washer fluid, rain and water. Wipers are fitted on all heavy motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, rail line locomotives, and some aircraft.  Safety standards for motor vehicles in adverse weather are important even at low speeds, therefore I began developing a wiper control system with arm-based microcontrollers. Rubber blades are mounted to the metal arms, while pivot magnets are mounted to the other ends. This project helps the user in their everyday lives by avoiding accidents and ensuring for secure and healthful travel. Thus, windshild wipers enhance visibility, efficiency, and reliability.
